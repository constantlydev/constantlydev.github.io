	<h1> What I have been doing... - June 14, 2022 </h1>
<p> It has been 2 months and 1 day since the last blog post and I 
wanted to make sure you all did not think I abandoned the website. <br> I was doing small stuff, like making a new YouTube channel and learning some techniques. If you are not in <a href="https://discord.gg/kGeJqDPrdr">OverPhil's Discord</a> (not sponsored), <br> join it! I usually hang there. 
Anways, I have been learning pixel art and composing trash music! I will show 1 
example <br> of my art (no music). <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/974438541025214504/982043661741203456/diamond_ore1.png" alt="Diamond ore"> Also, I recently <br> started learning Blender using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD">Blender Guru's </a>tutorial. And that is it. See, small. Anyways, see you in the next post!</p>
