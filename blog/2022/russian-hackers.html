    <h1> Russian Hackers are targeting my friends? | April 13, 2022 </h1>
<p> This is a weird blog post for the first "real" one. So recently my friend (whom I will keep anonymous)
got hacked on Steam.<br>Luckily, they did get their account back. But something was off to me. My other friend was
had the IP of the hacker. <br> Another friend also had someone trying to hack into their Steam account. <br>
I searched the IP and another IP that was from Russia and we found this. <br>

Now, if you had a keen eye, you would've noticed that the company name in both IPs <b> were the
same company. </b><br> DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNNNN. Anways, my friend did some research on the company
and found this.<br> <img src="assets/knownhacker.png" width="350" height="500" alt="Russian Hacker known??">

<br> <br> <br><b> They were known for trying to hack into Discord, Roblox, and Steam.</b> <br>
A rumor was spreading too, that <a href="https://is.gd/I9jH5c" target="_blank">tubers93</a> was Russian.
What if he was part of the group. That is all the info I have currently, <br> but I will make more blog posts
about the topic.</p>
